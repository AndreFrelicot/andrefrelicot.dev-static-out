        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <div class="app-name">LLMVoice</div>
        <div class="last-updated">Last Updated: October 12, 2025</div>

        <div class="highlight-box">
            <h3>Privacy-First Commitment</h3>
            <p><strong>LLMVoice is designed with your privacy as the highest priority.</strong> All voice processing, transcription, and AI summarization occurs entirely on your device. We do not collect, transmit, or store any personal information. Your voice recordings and transcriptions never leave your device.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>André Frélicot ("we," "our," or "us") operates the LLMVoice mobile application (the "App"). This Privacy Policy explains our practices regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of information that we receive through our App.</p>
        <p>By using LLMVoice, you agree to the terms outlined in this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with any part of this policy, please discontinue use of the App.</p>

        <h2>2. Information Collection and Use</h2>

        <h3>2.1 No Personal Data Collection</h3>
        <p><strong>LLMVoice does not collect, store, or transmit any personal information.</strong> We have designed our App to function entirely on your device without requiring any data to be sent to external servers or third parties.</p>

        <h3>2.2 Local Processing Only</h3>
        <p>All features of the App, including but not limited to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Voice recording</li>
            <li>Speech-to-text transcription</li>
            <li>AI-powered text summarization</li>
            <li>Data storage</li>
        </ul>
        <p>are processed locally on your device using iOS 26's SpeechAnalyzer API, Apple's Foundation Models framework, and/or MLX Swift framework. No audio, text, or any other data is transmitted over the internet or to any third-party services.</p>

        <h3>2.3 No Analytics or Tracking</h3>
        <p>We do not use any analytics services, tracking tools, or third-party SDKs that collect usage data, device information, or behavioral patterns. The App does not contain any mechanisms for monitoring how you use the application.</p>

        <h2>3. Permissions Required</h2>
        <p>To provide its core functionality, LLMVoice requires the following device permissions:</p>

        <h3>3.1 Microphone Access</h3>
        <p>The App requires access to your device's microphone to record audio for transcription purposes. Audio recording only occurs when you explicitly initiate a recording session by pressing the record button. All recorded audio is processed on-device and is never transmitted externally.</p>

        <h3>3.2 Speech Recognition</h3>
        <p>The App uses iOS 26's on-device speech recognition capabilities to transcribe your voice recordings into text. This processing occurs entirely on your device using Apple's SpeechAnalyzer API and does not require internet connectivity.</p>

        <h3>3.3 Permission Control</h3>
        <p>You maintain full control over these permissions and may revoke them at any time through your device's Settings app. Please note that revoking these permissions will prevent the App from functioning as intended.</p>

        <h2>4. Data Storage</h2>

        <h3>4.1 Local Storage Only</h3>
        <p>All data generated by the App, including transcriptions, summaries, and user preferences, is stored locally on your device using iOS's secure storage mechanisms (UserDefaults and local file system). This data remains on your device and is never synchronized to cloud services or transmitted to external servers.</p>

        <h3>4.2 Data Persistence</h3>
        <p>Your transcriptions and summaries persist between app sessions and will remain on your device until you delete them using the App's built-in delete functionality or uninstall the App.</p>

        <h3>4.3 No Backup to External Services</h3>
        <p>The App does not implement any automatic backup functionality to external services. Your data is subject to your device's standard iOS backup procedures (iCloud Backup or iTunes/Finder backup), which are controlled by your device settings and Apple's privacy policies.</p>

        <h2>5. AI Models and Processing</h2>

        <h3>5.1 On-Device AI Models</h3>
        <p>LLMVoice utilizes the following on-device AI technologies:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>iOS 26 SpeechAnalyzer:</strong> Apple's built-in speech recognition system</li>
            <li><strong>Apple Intelligence (Foundation Models):</strong> Available on compatible devices (iPhone 15 Pro or later)</li>
            <li><strong>MLX Swift Framework:</strong> Open-source machine learning models running locally on your device</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>5.2 Model Downloads</h3>
        <p>When using MLX-based models, the App may download AI model files from public repositories (HuggingFace). These downloads contain only the model weights and configuration files necessary for local inference. No personal data is transmitted during these downloads.</p>

        <h3>5.3 No Cloud AI Services</h3>
        <p>The App does not use any cloud-based AI services, APIs, or remote servers for processing your voice recordings or generating summaries. All AI inference occurs entirely on your device.</p>

        <h2>6. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p><strong>LLMVoice does not integrate with any third-party services, APIs, or SDKs</strong> that collect, process, or transmit user data. The App operates as a standalone application without external dependencies beyond the standard iOS system frameworks provided by Apple.</p>

        <h2>7. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>LLMVoice does not knowingly collect any information from children under the age of 13. Since the App does not collect any personal information from any users, it is safe for use by individuals of all ages. Parents and guardians should supervise children's use of the App as appropriate.</p>

        <h2>8. Data Security</h2>
        <p>While LLMVoice does not collect or transmit personal data, we take the security of your locally stored data seriously:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>All data is stored using iOS's secure storage mechanisms</li>
            <li>The App leverages iOS's built-in security features, including app sandboxing and data protection</li>
            <li>Your device's passcode, Face ID, or Touch ID provide additional security for your data</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You are responsible for maintaining the security of your device, including setting a strong passcode and keeping your iOS software up to date.</p>

        <h2>9. Data Retention and Deletion</h2>

        <h3>9.1 User-Controlled Data</h3>
        <p>You have complete control over your data. You may delete individual transcriptions and summaries at any time using the App's delete functionality (swipe-to-delete or bulk delete options).</p>

        <h3>9.2 Complete Data Removal</h3>
        <p>To completely remove all data associated with LLMVoice, you may:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Delete all summaries within the App using the "Clear All" function in Settings</li>
            <li>Uninstall the App from your device, which will remove all locally stored data</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>9.3 No Recovery After Deletion</h3>
        <p>Because we do not maintain any backups or servers, data that you delete cannot be recovered. Please ensure you truly wish to delete data before doing so.</p>

        <h2>10. International Users</h2>
        <p>LLMVoice is available for download worldwide. Since all processing occurs on your device and no data is transmitted externally, there are no international data transfer concerns. The App complies with privacy regulations including GDPR (European Union), CCPA (California), and other applicable privacy laws by virtue of not collecting any personal data.</p>

        <h2>11. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices, legal requirements, or App features. When we make changes, we will update the "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy and, if changes are significant, we will provide notice through the App or the App Store listing.</p>
        <p>We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically. Your continued use of LLMVoice after any changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.</p>

        <h2>12. Your Rights</h2>
        <p>Because LLMVoice does not collect, store, or process any personal data on external servers, many common privacy rights related to data access, correction, and deletion are inherently satisfied:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Right to Access:</strong> You have complete access to all your data through the App interface</li>
            <li><strong>Right to Deletion:</strong> You can delete any or all of your data at any time through the App</li>
            <li><strong>Right to Data Portability:</strong> Your data remains on your device and is not locked into any proprietary format</li>
            <li><strong>Right to Object:</strong> No data processing requires your objection since no data leaves your device</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>13. California Privacy Rights (CCPA)</h2>
        <p>Under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), California residents have specific rights regarding their personal information. However, since LLMVoice does not collect, sell, or share any personal information, these rights are satisfied by design:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>We do not collect personal information</li>
            <li>We do not sell personal information</li>
            <li>We do not share personal information with third parties</li>
            <li>We do not discriminate based on privacy rights</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>14. European Union (GDPR) Compliance</h2>
        <p>For users in the European Union, LLMVoice complies with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) through its privacy-by-design approach:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Legal Basis:</strong> No personal data processing occurs beyond what is necessary for the App's core functionality on your device</li>
            <li><strong>Data Minimization:</strong> We collect no data beyond what is locally generated for App functionality</li>
            <li><strong>Purpose Limitation:</strong> All data remains on your device for the sole purpose of providing transcription and summarization services</li>
            <li><strong>Storage Limitation:</strong> You control data retention through the App's delete functions</li>
            <li><strong>No Data Transfers:</strong> No data is transferred outside your device, eliminating cross-border transfer concerns</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>15. Consent</h2>
        <p>By downloading, installing, and using LLMVoice, you consent to the practices described in this Privacy Policy. When you first launch the App, you will be asked to grant permissions for microphone and speech recognition access. These permissions are necessary for the App to function and can be managed through your device settings at any time.</p>
