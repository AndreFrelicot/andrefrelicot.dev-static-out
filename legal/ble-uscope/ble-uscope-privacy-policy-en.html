        <ul>
            <li><strong>Bluetooth Scanning:</strong> The Application scans for nearby Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) devices using your device's Bluetooth hardware. All scanning and analysis occurs locally on your device.</li>

        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>4. Bluetooth Permissions</h2>
