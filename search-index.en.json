While remaining deeply rooted in technology, I’m also interested in new ways software is consumed: virality, customer acquisition through social media (UGC), and marketing strategies. Where software merges with content.  \n\nMy role is evolving into that of a **Digital Strategist**, envisioning, distributing, and selling both mobile applications and SaaS solutions.  \n\n**Motto: Tech – Product – Business**  \n\n---\n\n# Freelancing  \n\n✨ **I help businesses turn their ideas into high-performing mobile and web applications.**  \n\nI remain available for short-term freelance projects.  \nMy focus is on iOS mobile app development (**SwiftUI**) and cross-platform apps (**React Native, Ionic**), as well as modern web applications (**React / Next.js**), deployed on high-performance cloud solutions (**Vercel, Supabase, Firebase, Neon, Convex**).  \n\n🔥 For the first project, I offer a **50% discount**.  \nMy hourly rate is **$95/h**.  \n\n📩 Contact: **andre@frelicot.com**  \n\n---\n\n# Company  \n\n**Osibits**  \n60 rue François 1er  \n75008 Paris  \nFRANCE  \n\nD-U-N-S® Number: 283708389  \nSIRET: 939 948 865 00018  \nVAT: FR56 939948865  \n","image":"/images/2025/about.webp","date":"2025-09-22"}]}
