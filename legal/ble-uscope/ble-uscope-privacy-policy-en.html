        <ul>
            <li><strong>Bluetooth Scanning:</strong> The Application scans for nearby Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) devices using your device's Bluetooth hardware. All scanning and analysis occurs locally on your device.</li>
            <li><strong>Device Analysis:</strong> Any BLE device information discovered is processed and displayed solely within the Application on your device.</li>
            <li><strong>Local Storage:</strong> User preferences, favorite devices, and settings are stored locally on your device using iOS or Android local storage mechanisms. This data never leaves your device.</li>

        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>4. Bluetooth Permissions</h2>
